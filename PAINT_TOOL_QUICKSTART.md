# Paint Tool Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started with the Paint Tool

### Switching to Paint Tool

2. Press **B** key on your keyboard

### Selecting a Color
When the Paint tool is active, you'll see the palette in the Tools panel:
- Click on any color swatch to select it
- The selected color will be used for painting

### Painting Tiles
**To Paint:**
- Click on any tile in the canvas
- Drag across multiple tiles to paint continuously
- The cursor shows a preview of the color you'll paint

**To Erase:**
Choose any of these methods:
1. **Right-click** on the tile
2. **Two-finger tap** on trackpad (macOS)
3. **Hold E key** + left-click

### Visual Feedback
